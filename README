LAUNCHING THE SERVER

1. Open up a command line and navigate into the 'rendezview' directory. 
2. Type 'rake db:create' and press Enter.

(These commands will populate your MySQL database with the necessary fields)

OTHER NOTES

If you are getting an error about your rails/gem version, 
check the environment.rb file in the config directory. 
Make sure that RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.1.0'

Certain packages have their own web/mail servers installed -
we recommend using the WEBrick server.

On Windows, if you get the mysql error when trying to migrate,
download http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/InstantRails-win/InstantRails/mysql/bin/libmySQL.dll
and put that in C:/ruby/bin/mysql 5.1
